hello, as in "text_1", its another text but named "agario_1", this means its about agario
lets start
while you are in agar.io, it is that game
but...
dont get eaten by the other cells or be split-killed, if you get, you need to start everything again, continuing on #6
ok, #5 was so long, if you eat anyone or split kill anyone and the 1 that you ate disconnected, that means you did "REKT" to him
